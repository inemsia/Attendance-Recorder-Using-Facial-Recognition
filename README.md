# Attendance-Recorder-Using-Facial-Recognition
For this project, we aim to build an attendance recorder web application using facial recognition. The goal is to use the webcam of the computer to take input of attendees, and scan data from their faces to add the people that walk through the camera frame. The project makes use of Siamese Neural Networks to achieve this. 

## What was done
- Importing the dataset
- Preprocessing data
- Splitting the data
- Building and training our model
- Building an interface that uses a list of students, our model and a camera to record and update attendance of students, as well as register new students.

## Current Error
My attendance recording function is not fully functional because of lack of accuracy of the model, as well as debugging issues. 

## Future steps
- Improve model accuracy through modifying the training process
- Test more Siamese neural network model structures 
- Build a web application that can be used as an interface for the program
- Finish debugging attendance taking function.

## How to run
You can run the program by running the main file (Jupyter notebook).
